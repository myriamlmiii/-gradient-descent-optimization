This project includes Python scripts that help find the lowest point (minimum) of some math functions using a method called gradient descent. 
We change the scripts a bit for different tasks to see how they behave.

#How to set up?
you will need to have the followin library : 
```
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

#How to run it?
Open your command line or terminal. Go to the folder where you downloaded these scripts and run them one by one:
```
python question1.py
python question2.py
python question3.py
python question4.py
python question5.py
```

#What is the expected output ? 

Each script will show you:
- The points it goes through to find the minimum.
- How steep the slope is at each point.
- A picture showing the path it took.
